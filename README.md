# HAL
An HAskell Lisp interpreter developed during my 3rd year of study in EPITECH Nantes.

## Building the project

First you need to install the [Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/)

### Using Makefile

```sh
$ make all
```
or
```sh
$ make re #This will call a full clean rule before building
```

### Using stack

```sh
$ stack clean #This will clean all the temp file created at build (not necessary for 1st build)
$ stack build
$ stack run
```
